## Built with

- Basic HTML5 markup
- JavaScrript


## Reflection Questions

1. Challenges faced during the project.
    -- impleamenting functionality I know in react in vanilla js
2. How you approached solving those challenges.
    -- I wrote a lot of repeatitive code 
3. What you would improve if given more time.
    -- I would add responsive and aria complient layouts, more styling.
    -- A detailed view for the task
    -- a create button for category
